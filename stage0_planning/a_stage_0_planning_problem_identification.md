# A. Stage 0 - Planning and Problem Identification
>	Here you will briefly explain the domain of the problem you identified, briefly identify general challenges and, then, state you problem

# Context
[What is the context for your work. What area of application. It can be travelling, pet treatment, shopping. State the overall context and why it is interesting to think about it.]

The context of our work is education, specifically student engagement and motivation in academic studies. Many students struggle to stay motivated throughout the semester, often procrastinating or failing to complete tasks on time. Traditional grading systems do not provide continuous feedback or incentives for consistent effort. Gamification has proven to be an effective approach to improving engagement in various fields, making it an interesting strategy to explore in education.

# Challenges
[What are aspects that remain a challenge? What is difficult to do? What could profit from a more customizable approach?]

* Designing a Flexible Yet Intuitive UI: The system needs to be highly customizable for teachers while remaining easy to use for students. Striking this balance is technically complex.
* Handling Real-Time Data and Leaderboards: Ensuring that student progress, XP updates, and leaderboard rankings are updated in real-time without performance issues requires efficient backend development.
* Preventing Cheating and Abuse: (In the personal version of the app) Avoiding exploits such as students creating easy tasks for quick XP or manipulating group project contributions will require careful system design and monitoring.
* XP Allocation: Allowing teachers to set XP values for different types of tasks based on their course structure.
* Task Creation: Enabling customization of task formats (e.g., quizzes, projects, assignments) to fit different teaching styles.
* Collaboration Settings: Letting students form study groups or “clans” with customizable competition settings.
* Progression Mechanics: Giving teachers options to modify level-up requirements, difficulty curves, and rewards based on their specific course needs.

# The goal
[In a short sentence state what is the problem you wish to address]

We aim to develop a gamified study system that motivates students to complete academic tasks by earning XP, leveling up, and ultimately reaching level 100 in all courses by the end of the semester.
