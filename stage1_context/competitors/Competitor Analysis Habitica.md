"Love this gamified todo app. Itâ€™s been perfect for getting me and my adhd brain completing tasks and remembering to do essential basic tasks. Would recommend it highly. I have all my friends and family habiticking too"

* #### Best feature was taken away

"I was a longtime user. The ressources that were provided by the community were most helpful - now that there are no social spaces anymore, this app is no better (and probably worse) than any app for to do lists. I moved to another app and now I also understand that Habitica doesn't include that many features for its price."

* ### Great gamified life management app


Andrei Radu, Jan 5, 2023

*5/5*

```
"Great life management app that uses gamification as a device for motivation!

In there you can customize your own "quests" in three categories:
1. Habits, which can be completed as many times as needed per day
2. Dailies, which can be completed once per day
3. To-do's, which can be completed once at any time and they disappear

Combined with character classes, levels, pets, mounts, items and much more, Habitica provides a new layer of meaning and motivation for the gaming-inclined user.

I really recommend it!"

* ### Rude staff, buggy app


Volunteer Contributor, Feb 4, 2023

*1/5*

```
"As an app, Habitica is buggy, slow to load and lacking in features with no significant new releases in years. But the staff promote the vibrant community as a major USP for their app. And it was vibrant... until they removed fired their moderation team with no preparation, alienated all volunteers on the platform and posted rude and threatening messages, violating their own community guidelines. Anyone speaking up against these changes is being muted or banned with no explanation. Give your custom to a deserving company, not this one.

Habitica; Do Better."

* ### Habitica seemed great at first


Charles Grey, Feb 8, 2023

*1/5*

"Habitica seemed great at first, but after a bit it just became boring and repetitive. I wish there was something more to work towards instead of just outfits. I always forget to even look at my tasks and there's just not much there to motivate me. Plus, the mods, who I found to be wonderful people, aren't working there anymore which I find quite sad. They were good at their jobs, the community was the one thing I liked about it."
