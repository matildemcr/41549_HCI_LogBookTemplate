# B. Stage 1 - Context Definition


# B.1. Competitor Identification
>	The competitor analysis will entail an identification of all competitors, with brief descriptions and a collection of the look and feel of their solutions, e.g., with screenshots, etc. It will also include a detailed analysis of the competitor deemed the best or more representative. It ends with a summary of the main findings including an HCI SWOT analysis



## B.1a. Competitors


| **Competitor**    | **Description**                             | Information repository              |

## B.1b. Detailed Competitor Analysis
>	Choose the most notable competitor and do a more thorough analysis of their interactive solution


### - Heuristic Evaluation

#### Method
[ Describe the method used for the heuristic evaluation: procedure, number of experts, heuristics, severity scale considered, how was consensus done.]


#### Individual Evaluations
<!-- For the individual heuristic evaluations by each member of the group, you can use the templates below, grouping problems by heuristic OR each evaluator can have a table listing all the detected problems with the number of the violated heuristics on the second column. Whichever your choice, you should have a list of problems, the severity, and a recommendation to mitigate it -->

- [expert2_heuristic_evaluation_workbook](heuristic_evaluations/expert2_heuristic_evaluation_workbook.md)

- [expert3_heuristic_evaluation_workbook](heuristic_evaluations/expert3_heuristic_evaluation_workbook.md)


#### Consensus

>	After the individual analysis by each expert, all results should be gathered in a consensus table. If an expert has not found any of the problems found by other experts, they should analyse it, at this point, and give it a severity.

| **Issue**       | **Expert 1** | Expert 2 | Expert 3 | Recommendations                             |
