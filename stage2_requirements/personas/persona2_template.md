## Background  
Joana is a passionate high school teacher dedicated to helping her students develop strong study habits. She believes that learning should be engaging and rewarding, but she often struggles with students forgetting homework and showing low participation in class. As a mother, she notices how engaged her son gets when playing video-games and would like to provoke that sensation in her students by using alike methods. While she sees the potential of digital tools to help her students stay on track, she isn’t very comfortable with technology and needs an intuitive system that doesn’t overwhelm her.  

## Daily Life  
Joana starts her day by preparing lesson plans and reviewing student progress. In class, she introduces new topics and encourages discussion, but she notices that many students lack motivation to study independently. To address this, she integrates digital tools to assign tasks and track student progress. However, she finds complex platforms frustrating and prefers solutions with a simple, intuitive interface. In the evenings, she balances family life with grading assignments and planning interactive ways to keep her students engaged.

## Goals & Needs  
Joana wants to encourage consistent study habits in her students by using competitive strategies to motivate them. She needs to find a tool that is easy to use and doesn’t require extensive tech knowledge to ensure students complete assigned tasks and homework, whilst mantaining them engaged and motivated throughout the whole year of studies.

## Pain Points & Challenges  
Joana's students frequently forget to complete homework assignments and she notices their lack of participation and interest in class quite often. She struggles with technology and prefers user-friendly solutions.  

## Motivation  
*"If I can make studying feel rewarding, my students will stay engaged and develop good habits. But I need a tool that’s simple and easy to manage without taking too much time from my teaching."*
