# Self-Evaluation and Workload

## Team Collaboration and workload

This project was completed as a team of 3 members. We divided the workload as follows:

| Task                        | Responsible Person | 
|-----------------------------|--------------------|
| Low-fidelity and High-fidelity prototype - Personal view      | Marta              |       |
| Low-fidelity and High-fidelity prototype - Academic Student view   | Catarina           |
| Low-fidelity and High-fidelity prototype - Academic Teacher view   | Matilde               |
| Documentation (Log Book)               | Workload was evenly distributed           | 
| Presentation materials (Powepoint)               | Workload was evenly distributed           | 



## Challenges Faced
- Figuring out how to implement gamification elements (XP, progress tracking).
- Interpreting user feedback constructively and turning it into design improvements.
- Learning a new framework.

## What Went Well

- Users responded nicely to the gamified and task management elements.
- Navigation and interface were quite intuitive after our high fidelity prototype evaluation.
- The project met the requirements set in the early stages.

## Lessons Learned

- How to design software in a user-centered way proved to be a challenge, demanding constant development and changes of the project.
- User evaluation is a crutial part of the development and making it early on proved to be helpful.


## Improvements and Future Work

- Add new features like daily streaks, multi-language support, avatar customization and some more gamification elements such as an item shop, clan quests, etc.
- Make the website fully responsive.
- Integrating a backend for real-time user data syncing (databases, user records).
- Make the interface a bit more related to the theme "LearnQuest".
- Separate the current individual messages by classes (on the teacher interface).
- Improve the submission checking section for the teacher's view.

## Self-evaluation
### Distributed workload percentages
- Matilde Rodrigues: 33.3%
- Catarina Ribeiro: 33.3%
- Marta Cruz: 33.3%

### Our proposal for the final grade
18
